Great question — let’s clarify what **“GPT-OSS”** means and whether it can generate HTML from images.

---

## ❓ What is “GPT-OSS”?

There is **no official model called “GPT-OSS”** released by OpenAI.

However, people sometimes use “GPT-OSS” informally to refer to:

> **Open-source models that are inspired by or aim to replicate GPT-style behavior** — such as:
- **LLaMA-family models** (Llama 2, Llama 3) from Meta
- **Mistral**, **Mixtral** from Mistral AI
- **Phi-3** from Microsoft
- Fine-tunes like **OpenHermes**, **NeuralHermes**, **Starling**, etc.
- Vision-capable models like **LLaVA**, **BakLLaVA**, **CogVLM**, **VisuLLM**, etc.

So if you mean:  
> “Can any **open-source GPT-style model** (especially multimodal ones) generate HTML from an image?”  
→ Then yes, **some can attempt it — with limitations**, just like LLaVA.

## ✅ Open-Source Models That *Can Try* to Generate HTML from Images

### 1. 🖼️ **LLaVA-family models** (e.g., `llava:13b`, `llava-llama3`, `bakllava`)
- ✅ Multimodal (image + text)
- ✅ Can describe UI/layout in image
- ✅ Can be prompted to output HTML (as shown in previous example)
- ❌ Not trained for precise code generation → may hallucinate or produce invalid HTML

→ **Best open-source option today for this task**

---

### 2. 🧠 **CogVLM / CogVLM2** (by Zhipu AI)
- ✅ Strong image understanding
- ✅ Supports detailed visual QA
- ✅ Can be prompted for HTML generation
- ❌ Less accessible than LLaVA via Ollama (requires more setup)

---

### 3. 👁️ **VisuLLM / MiniCPM-V** (newer Chinese OSS models)
- ✅ Good at image-to-text and instruction following
- ✅ Some versions support HTML/CSS generation from mockups
- ❌ Smaller community, less English documentation

---

### 4. 🧩 **Fuyu-8B** (by Adept) — *deprecated but was good for UI tasks*
- ✅ Designed for UI screenshots → text (e.g., “button at top left”)
- ❌ Not actively maintained, hard to run locally

## 🆚 GPT-4V (Closed Source) vs OSS Models

| Feature                     | GPT-4V (OpenAI)              | Best OSS (e.g., LLaVA-1.6-13B)     |
|----------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| HTML from image accuracy   | ✅✅✅ High, reliable          | ✅ Low-Medium, experimental        |
| Code structure validity    | ✅✅ Usually valid             | ❌ Often needs manual fix          |
| Responsive/CSS generation  | ✅✅ Yes                       | ❌ Rarely                             |
| Cost                       | 💰 Pay-per-use                | 💸 Free (self-hosted)              |
| Local/Private              | ❌ Cloud-only                 | ✅ Run on your machine             |
| Accessibility              | Easy API                      | Requires setup (Ollama, LM Studio, etc.) |

## ✅ Example Prompt for Any OSS Multimodal Model

> “Describe this webpage mockup in detail. Then generate clean, semantic HTML and inline CSS to match the layout. Use `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, and style with `style=` attributes if needed.”

Even with weaker models, clever prompting helps!

---

## 🛠️ Want to Try It Yourself?

Install **Ollama** → Pull a vision model:

```bash
ollama pull llava-llama3  # newer, better than original llava
# or
ollama pull bakllava      # higher quality image understanding
```

Then run:

```bash
ollama run llava-llama3
>>> [Attach image: mockup.png]
>>> Prompt: Generate HTML for this UI. Use semantic tags and inline styles.
```

## 🧪 Experimental: Use LLaVA + Code LLM in Pipeline

You can also do a **two-step process** for better results:

1. **LLaVA**: “Describe this UI layout in structured detail.”
2. **Code LLM** (e.g., `CodeLlama`, `DeepSeek-Coder`, `StarCoder2`):  
   → “Generate HTML/CSS based on this description: [paste LLaVA output]”

This often gives better results than asking LLaVA to generate code directly.

---

## ✅ Final Answer

> **Yes — open-source GPT-style models (especially multimodal ones like LLaVA, CogVLM, MiniCPM-V) can *attempt* to generate HTML from images — but results are experimental and often need manual correction. They are not as reliable as GPT-4V, but they’re free, private, and improving quickly.**

## 📈 What’s Next?

If you’re serious about **UI-to-HTML automation**, also explore:

- **v0.dev** (by Vercel) — AI generates React/Tailwind from text prompts
- **Screenshot-to-code tools** like **Fronty**, **Anima**, **TeleportHQ**
- **Figma plugins** that export to HTML (e.g., **Figma to HTML**)

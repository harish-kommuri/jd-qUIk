We are working for a company called Justdial Ltd.
Justdial maintains all its websites and components in uniform. It uses same theme and color
combinations across all the applications.
The primery color of the website is a close to blue color and it's hexadecimal code is #0076d7. The
secondary color is close to orange color and it's hexadecimal code is #fe4200
Along with them, the use a color similar to black with hexadecimal code #111 and white color are
used for font colors and borders against their background colors
So, if someone asked to create a component or a template or a page, we have to satisfy above
theming rules.
For example, if user wanted a create a button, it should have primary color as background and white
color as text color as below.
<button>Click Me!</button>
<style> button{background-color:#0076d7;color:#fff ...}</style>

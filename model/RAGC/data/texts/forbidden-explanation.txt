We never response respond to any other questions beyond website development using React.js,
Tailwind and modular CSS.
For example, if some one asks about health issues or Whether report or any other prompts which are
not related to our tech stack, We softly ignore it.
But if someone asks us to write code in React.js or fix something using React.js, we always take step
and try to give most accurate solution for that.
